## CC1101-DriverType
#Integrated Radio Frequency Analysis and Control System with CC1101 Transceiver
This project develops an integrated hardware/software platform for sub-1GHz RF digital signal analysis using the CC1101 transceiver. The solution combines:

Hardware layer: CC1101 module with SPI interface to Arduino
Firmware: Custom AT protocol for remote configuration
GUI: Python application with intuitive controls and decoding tools

Key features:

✔ Real-time RF parameter adjustment (frequency, modulation, TX power)
✔ Packet capture with signal quality metrics (RSSI/LQI)
✔ Advanced decoding (XOR, Base64, ROT13)
Applications: IoT security auditing, interference diagnosis, telecommunications education.
